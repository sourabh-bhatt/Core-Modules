// A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have.

// Classes are defined using the class keyword.

// For example, the following code defines a class called Animal:

class Animal {
  name = "Animal";
  speak() {
    return "I am an animal";
  }
}
