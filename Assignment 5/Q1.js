// In JavaScript, synchronous and asynchronous refer to different ways of executing code and handling operations.

// Synchronous: In synchronous programming, code is executed sequentially, one line at a time, and each line of code must complete before moving on to the next line. This means that if there is a blocking operation, such as a network request or a time-consuming task, the execution of the program will pause until that operation is completed.

// During this time, the program will not respond to any other events or user interactions. Synchronous operations are predictable and easier to reason about but can result in delays and unresponsiveness in the program.

console.log("Start");
const result = doSyncOperation();
console.log(result);
console.log("End");

// Asynchronous: In asynchronous programming, code does not wait for a blocking operation to complete. Instead, it continues to execute while the operation is being processed in the background. Asynchronous operations are typically used for tasks that may take some time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file.

// Callback functions, promises, and async/await are common mechanisms used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

console.log("Start");

doAsyncOperation(function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});

console.log("End");
