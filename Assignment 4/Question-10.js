// The spread operator (...) is a new feature in JavaScript that allows you to spread the elements of an array or object into another array or object. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as copying arrays, concatenating arrays, and initializing objects.

// For example

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newNumbers = [...numbers];

console.log(newNumbers); // [1, 2, 3]

// The ...numbers syntax spreads the elements of the numbers array into the newNumbers array. This creates a new array that contains the same elements as the numbers array.
