// Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?

// Ans: The ECMAScript 6 is the major edition of ECMAScript 2015 which is ECMAScript language specification standard. It came up with a major update with the javascript langauage. Few of them are as follows:

// 1. Let and const keywords. These keywords are used to declare variables, and they have some important differences from the var keyword. let variables are block scoped, while const variables are immutable.
// 2. Arrow functions. Arrow functions are a new type of function that are concise and easy to read. They are also more efficient than traditional functions.
// 3. Template literals. Template literals are a new way to create strings that support interpolation and expressions. They are much more powerful than the traditional string literals.
// 4. Destructuring. Destructuring is a new way to extract data from objects and arrays. It can make code more concise and easier to read.
// 5. Classes. Classes are a new way to create objects in JavaScript. They are similar to classes in other object-oriented languages.
// 6. Modules. Modules are a new way to organize code in JavaScript. They allow you to import and export code from different files.
// 7. Block-Scoped Declarations (let and const): The let and const keywords were introduced to declare variables with block scope, allowing better control over variable scoping and reducing issues with hoisting.
// 8. Rest and Spread Operators: The rest (...) and spread (...) operators provide a concise way to work with variable-length argument lists in functions, as well as to clone or merge arrays and objects.
// 9. Promises: Promises are a built-in way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They simplify working with callbacks and provide a cleaner syntax for chaining asynchronous actions.
