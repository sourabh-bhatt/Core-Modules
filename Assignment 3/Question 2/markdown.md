Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS?

Ans: In CSS we use a rule called `@media` to define the medaia query. It follows with the type of media and the conditions it is going to meet.

For example,

```CSS
@media only screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background-color: green;
  }
}
```
