Q.5 What is the purpose of the orientation media feature?

Ans: The orientation media feature in CSS is used to for the orientation of the viewport (or the page box, for paged media). The viewport is the area of the screen that is visible to the user. The orientation of the viewport can be portrait or landscape.

- `portrait`: The viewport is in a portrait orientation, i.e., the height is greater than or equal to the width.

- `landscape`: The viewport is in a landscape orientation, i.e., the width is greater than the height.
